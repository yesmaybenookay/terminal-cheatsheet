## Description:

The Linux Terminal Command Cheatsheet is my collection of cheatsheets I've made for various command line tools I use on Fedora Linux. The contents here only cover a small portion of what some of these tools can do so be sure to explore more with ```[command] --help``` or ```man [command]```. Additionally, I've tried to include at least one URL linking to additional info / help for each tool.

```sh
espeak -a 200 -g 11 -p 99 "YOURTEXT" -s 110 -v en-us
```

Use [```godspeaks```](https://github.com/yesmaybenookay/terminal-cheatsheet#godspeaks) to generate text to speak:

```sh
python godspeaks.py | espeak -a 200 -g 11 -p 99 -s 110 -v en-us
```

*My favorite voices:*

 * af
 * en
 * en-us
 * ru
 * vi
 * vi-hue
 * vi-sgn
 * zh
 * zh-yue

```

Also works great with [espeak](https://github.com/yesmaybenookay/terminal-cheatsheet#espeak):

## Footnotes

### 1. Notes on Persistence

**Limited Lifetime of Persistent Overlay**

One very important note about using the "primary" persistent overlay for system changes is that due to the way it's currently implemented (as a Device-mapper copy-on-write snapshot), every single change to it (writes AND deletes) subtracts from its free space, so it will eventually be "used up" and your USB stick will no longer boot [see this dm-devel discussion](http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel.device-mapper.devel/14644) and [this page](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/LiveOS_image#Overlay_recovery) (for emergency recovery). Because of these limitations, it is advisable to use the system-level persistence sparingly, for configuration changes and important security updates only. Or, if you have sufficient disk space available, changes to the LiveOS root filesystem snapshot can be merged into a new copy of the root filesystem. See [this page section](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/LiveOS_image#Merge_overlay_into_new_image) for instructions.

See [this section](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Nicolassatragno/liveUSB#Mounting_a_Live_USB_filesystem) for mounting the root filesystem outside of a boot.

For normal, write-many storage (vs the write-once overlay), use the ```--home-size-mb``` option to create a home directory filesystem for personal files. The home.img can be re-used and loop mounted outside of the Live USB environment.
